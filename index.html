    <h2>Viktorija</h2>

    <p>Simply call me Vicky, as 'j' is pronounced differently to how locals here would :D name is as original 'Victoria' 
    </p>   
    
    <p>I love to travel and explore new places wether that's cities or nature or an experience that I never had before and this interlocks with my passion for landscape, architecture and detail photography 
    </p>
    
    <p>I am in my 2nd year of Media and Culture degree in Birkbeck, previously I studied Architecture
